# Netflix-Clone
This is the Landing page of the Netflix.

This repository showcases my own version of the Netflix Landing Page, meticulously cloned as part of my ongoing journey to enhance my HTML and CSS skills. Motivated by a desire to put my recently acquired knowledge into practice, I undertook this project with great enthusiasm and dedication.

Throughout this journey, I encountered various obstacles and hurdles, which served as valuable learning opportunities. I pushed myself to ensure pixel-perfect precision, meticulous attention to detail, and responsiveness across different screen sizes. This project allowed me to sharpen my coding skills, improve my understanding of front-end development principles, and gain practical experience in creating visually stunning web pages.

I am excited to share this repository with you as it represents the culmination of my efforts to expand my skill set and embrace new challenges. Feel free to explore the code, examine the structure, and witness the culmination of my HTML and CSS knowledge in this Netflix Landing Page clone.
